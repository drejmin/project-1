# Project 1 Pitch 'I Declare War'

I declare war is a staple card game that is enjoyed by many. The goal is to take all of your opponents' cards and collect the full deck back. Points can also be gained and it can be played based on rounds instead for a quicker version of the game.

## Elevator Pitch

Growing up I played this game with my siblings before school as we waited for our classes to start. It is an excellent game to just waste time and not have to think. It is completely based on luck where you just literally play the cards that you are dealt without knowing what you picked.

If you get tired of playing the standard game, you may spice it up a bit since there are many rules that can be added to enhance the fun of the game. For instance, playing with 2 joker cards that can win any skirmish, deuce you lose where twos, the lowest cards, beat aces, the highest ones, and Jack of all Trades where Jacks beat Kings instead of the other way around. There can be other rules added such as a second deck of high ranks for the times where a win is NEEDED to survive or even a layout game where you can pick from cards lined up in a grid rather than just the top card.

This game is fun when playing with friends and has no requirements for anyone to start playing.

## Tech Stacks

<li>The game will use HTML to hold the game.
<li>JavaScript to create the logic
<li>CSS to create the array of card objects and to render in the browser.

## MVP Goals
<ul>
<li>Render a game board with a minimum of 2 players.
<li>Render cards that can be played during your turn.
<li>Allow cards to be shuffled before each match.
<li>Include instructions on how to play.
<li>State who wins each round, how many cards left and who won the full game.
<li>Have a reset button always availiable.
<li>The result of a cards with the same value will lead to a 'War'.
</ul>

## Stretch Goals

<li>Allow the use of rule changes before the game to set up.
<li>Have the ability for multiple computer opponents.
<li>Allow the use of a 3 card deck of high rank cards that is distributed between players with one random small card.
<li>Allow a line-up style play where instead of choosing from deck cards are lined up face down and player is allowed to choose.
<li>ability to change deck back

## Potential Roadblocks

<li>Getting the design to be fluid enough that the changes in game play will not affect the experience of the user.

<li>Letting checkboxes to create changes in the code so that the game plays differently

<li>Creating an ability for multiple computers to work from multiple randomized decks
